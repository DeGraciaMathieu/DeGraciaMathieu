### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy creating static analysis tools to understand and measure the quality of a PHP application.

Here are some of my tools :

- [php-smelly-code-detector](https://github.com/DeGraciaMathieu/php-smelly-code-detector) : Detects code smells by assessing complexity to identify potentially problematic code.
- [php-wording-detector](https://github.com/DeGraciaMathieu/php-wording-detector) : Simple tool to analyze and split the words contained in your code to check your DDD approach.
- [php-git-insights-analyzer](https://github.com/DeGraciaMathieu/php-git-insights-analyzer) : Analyze the Git history of your PHP files.
- [php-line-length-detector](https://github.com/DeGraciaMathieu/php-line-length-detector) : A simple way to analyze the line length of your PHP files.
- [php-arguments-detector](https://github.com/DeGraciaMathieu/php-arguments-detector) : Keep control over the complexity of your methods by checking that they do not have too many arguments.
- [php-variable-lifetime-analyzer](https://github.com/DeGraciaMathieu/php-variable-lifetime-analyzer) : Track your variables' lifetime to encourage shorter scopes.
- [php-class-dependencies-analyzer](https://github.com/DeGraciaMathieu/php-class-dependencies-analyzer) : This tool allows you to monitor the dependencies and instability of your classes.
